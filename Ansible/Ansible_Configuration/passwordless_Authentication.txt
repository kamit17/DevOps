 Create same user(ansadmin) across all servres and provide password for all users

 create new user in  the ansible engine server
 (ansadmin) by switchin to root ( sudo su -  ))
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin
 user is : ansadmin/admin123

 The user we created here , we need to create across all regions

 The next step is to create the same across users the managed nodes( AWS EC2 )


once the users are created, then create the ssh file on your engine node
sudo su - ansadmin
ssh-keygen



once the ssh is created , you need to copy it to the managed nodes
ssh-copy-id <public Ip of your managed nodes>
54.197.1.35
34.202.161.211
34.227.221.196

Provide the IP of the managed nodes in  the inventory file
 cd /etc/ansible
 vi hosts
 [ansadmin@centos7 ansible]$ sudo vi hosts

verify connectivity by running ansible all -m ping


if you get pong for ping then its working fine
