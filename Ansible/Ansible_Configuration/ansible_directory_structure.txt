 default ansible location is /etc/ansible ( under root )

 [ansadmin@centos7 ansible]$ tree /etc/ansible/

└── roles

ansible.cfg --> we can provide the location of library, modules,Plugins
hosts -- > we provide the ip/hostname of managed nodes in hosts. This is the ansible inventory file .


if you want to create a new inventory file then create that instead of hosts and while calling you can call using ansible -m ping all <inventory file name>
