steps to configure Ansible
Requirement for Managed node /client
    python 2 or python3
if we don't have python on  managed node, we can work with managed mode using raw modules


ANsible Engine uses SSH connection to connect and work with Managed nodes

We can creaet ssh Connection in two ways:
    Password Authentication
    With SSH Keys

Provide the Manged NOdes IP/FQDN in inventory files on Ansible Engine


Test the configuration by running: ansible all -m ping
